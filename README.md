# Box Busters

> After years of nonstop investigation, we've finally found out who's been
> cluttering our poor, beautiful warehouses! Unfortunately, finding out
> whodunnit is only half the battle; there's still the matter of getting rid of
> all these boxes! Here's your assignment: destroy them all! I don't care how
> you do it, be it smashing them, burning them, or even eating them, just get
> it done! Don't worry about cleaning up the mess, either; we'll just beam it
> out of your way so you can focus on a job well done.
